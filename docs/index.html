<h4>openEO.ai: FAIR learning models for Copernicus data</h4>
<p>
The openEO.ai project has the objective to make the development, application, sharing and evaluation of learning (AI) models to Copernicus Earth Observation data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Building upon the existing open source openEO API, an interface between popular data science languages (Python, R, JavaScript) for analysing Earth Observation data on a variety of cloud-based compute back-ends, openEO.ai will develop interfaces and client and server implementations for a variety of learning models. By doing so, it will not only make it easier to apply learning models but also simplify comparisons between modelling approaches, various AI model implementations, and handling of ground truth datasets used for training and testing models. Model federation will be explored for updating and adapting pre-trained models across different nodes of the European Open Science cloud. Model evaluation strategies will be adapted to move beyond the naive assumption that training data are spatially and temporally independent. In a number of use cases, the developed methodology will be demonstrated, and teaching materials will be developed for educating FAIR use of AI models to the new generation of Earth Observation specialists.
