<h4>openEO.ai: FAIR learning models for Copernicus data</h4>
<p>
The openEO.ai project has the objective to make the development, application, sharing and evaluation of learning (AI) models to Copernicus Earth Observation data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). Building upon the existing open source openEO API, an interface between popular data science languages (Python, R, JavaScript) for analysing Earth Observation data on a variety of cloud-based compute back-ends, openEO.ai will develop interfaces and client and server implementations for a variety of learning models. By doing so, it will not only make it easier to apply learning models but also simplify comparisons between modelling approaches, various AI model implementations, and handling of ground truth datasets used for training and testing models. These FAIR AI modelling approaches will be demonstrated on four use cases, addressing wetland mapping, snow monitoring, soil moisture, and irrigated agriculture. In addition, a number of methodological innovations for AI modelling of Copernicus data will be developed, and demonstrated in selected use cases. Model federation will be used for updating and adapting pre-trained models across different cloud nodes. Hybrid AI/physical modelling will be applied to enhance physical models, e.g. for soil moisture prediction. Explainable AI models will be developed for increasing trust in model predictions. Model evaluation strategies will be adapted to move beyond the naive assumption that training data are spatially and temporally independent, or that training data are error free. Teaching materials will be developed for educating FAIR use of AI models to the new generation of Earth Observation specialists, and will be used in workshops.
